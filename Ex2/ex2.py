# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print 'This will print'    # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to 'disable' or comment out a piece of code:
# print 'This won\'t print'

print 'This will print, as well.'
