# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
## Study Drills
### Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
Per my answer in Exercise 1's README file, I was correct in my understanding of comments in Python and the ideal Pythonic implementation.
### Take your ```ex2.py``` file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
See next drill - thanks!
### Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
In reviewing my code in reverse (a handy neuro hack, for sure, when debugging) I did not encounter any errors.

NOTE: The output of my script, ```ex2.py``` is shown below.

Output:
```
(venv)marclaughton at MacBookPro in ~/Development/Projects/Learn_Python_The_Hard_Way/Ex2 on develop*
 âžœ  python ex2.py
This will print
This will print, as well.
```
### Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
A additional verbal review of the code again concluded that there were no previously overlooked errors/mistakes present in my program.
