# Exercise 1: A Good First Program
## Study Drills
### Make your script print another line
See ```ex1_study_drill_1.py```
### Make your script print only one of the lines
See ```ex2_study_drill_2.py```
### Put a ```#``` character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find what this character does.
The octothorpe is a syntax signifier for the beginning of a comment. An example
of how I might use comments and their variations.

```python
# This is a single-line block comment
print 'Hello world'

print 'Hello world again'    # This is an inline comment

# This
# is a block
# comment (per PEP8 standards, block comments are preferable to inline)
print 'Goodbye'
```
