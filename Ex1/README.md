Hello World!
Hello again
I like typing this.
This is fun
Yay! Printing.
I'd rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
"I, Maximus of Gloucester, to You - by Charles Olson"

Off-shore, by islands hidden in the blood
         jewels & miracles, I, Maximus
         a metal hot from boiling water, tell you
         what is a lance, who obeys the figures of
         the present dance

the thing you're after
may lie around the bend
of the nest (second, time slain, the bird! the bird!
And there! (strong) thrust, the mast! flight
             (of the bird
             o kylix, o
             Antony of Padua
             sweep low, o bless

the roofs, the old ones, the gentle steep ones
on whose ridge-polls the gulls sit, from which they depart,
             And the flake-racks
of my city!

### Make your script print only one of the lines
See ```ex2_study_drill_2.py```

Output:
```

 ➜  python ex1_study_drill_2.py
Yay! Printing.
Hello World!
```
### Put a ```#``` character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find what this character does.
The octothorpe is a syntax signifier for the beginning of a comment. An example
of how I might use comments and their variations.

```python
# This is a single-line block comment
print 'Hello world'

print 'Hello world again'    # This is an inline comment

# This
# is a block
# comment (per PEP8 standards, block comments are preferable to inline)
print 'Goodbye'
```
