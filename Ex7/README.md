# Exercise 7: More Printing
## Study Drills
### Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
See ```ex7.py``` for more details.
### Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
Upon review, there were no errors present in the script.
### From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
Duly noted - I tend to this naturally as I come across unusual or difficult code, so I have a dynamic
reference guide that grows with me as a developer who works in multiple languages, and multiple business applications.
### When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code
as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
>>-- Brian Kernighan

>It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're looking for it; it's even harder when you've
assumed your code is bug-free.
>>-- Steve McConnell

### Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
Ne'er a truer word was spoken...we are all recipients of great benefit if we aim to write clean, readable, and focused code.
Writing 'clever' code for the sake of cleverness can and will derail progress.
