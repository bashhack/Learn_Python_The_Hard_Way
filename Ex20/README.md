# Exercise 20: Functions and Files
## Study Drills
### Write English comments for each line to understand what that line does.


### Each time ```print_a_line``` is run, you are passing in a variable ```current_line```. Write out what ```current_line``` is equal to on each function call, and trace how it becomes ```line_count``` in ```print_a_line```.


### Find each place a function is used, and check its ```def``` to make sure that you are giving it the right arguments.


### Research online what the ```seek``` function for ```file``` does. Try ```pydoc file``` and see if you can figure it out from there. Then try ```pydoc file.seek``` to see what seek does.


### Research the shorthand notation ```+=``` and rewrite the script to use ```+=``` instead.
