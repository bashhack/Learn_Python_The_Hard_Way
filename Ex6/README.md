# Exercise 6: Strings and Text
## Study Drills
### Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
See ```ex6.py``` for details.
### Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
We have the following occurrences:
```
y = 'Those who know %s and those who %s.' % (binary, do_not)    # (1, 2)
```

```
print 'I said: %r.' % x    # (3)
```

```
print 'I also said: %s.' % y    # (4)
```
### Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
Strictly speaking, the four instances I noted above are the places where a string object is nested
 within another string object. It should be noted that the following line still counts because
 ```print 'I said: %r.' % x``` the string formatter ```%r``` returns a string, just like ```%s``` does.
### Explain why adding the two strings ```w``` and ```e``` with ```+``` makes a longer string.
Adding these two vars (which happen to be of object type ```str```) results in the creation of
 a longer string of the same type as we are concatenating their respective values.

I have included a short example to demonstrate this further. Note that the interpreter throws an
 error if we attempt to concatenate an object of type ```str``` with an object of type ```int```.
