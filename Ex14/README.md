# Exercise 14: Prompting and Passing
## Study Drills
### Find out what Zork and Adventure were. Try to find a copy and play it.
### Change the ```prompt``` variable to something else entirely.
### Add another argument and use it in your script, the same way you did in the previous exercise with ```first, second = ARGV```.
### Make sure you understand how I combined a ```"""```` style multiline string with the ```%``` format activator as the last print.

Hi Marc, I'm the ex14.py script.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Do you like me, Marc?
> sure, well enough I suppose
Where do you live, Marc?
> Austin, TX
What kind of computer do you have?
> Macbook Pro and a Macbook Air

Alright, so you said 'sure, well enough I suppose' about liking me.
You live in 'Austin, TX'. Not sure where that is.
And you have a 'Macbook Pro and a Macbook Air' computer. Nice.
